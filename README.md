## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`
3. Create an AUTH_SECRET token: `npx auth secret`
4. Fill in all the `.env.local` placeholder values
5. Set up your database:
   - **Option A (Local Docker)**: Start the database: `npm run db:start`
   - **Option B (Neon or other hosted Postgres)**: Set `POSTGRES_URL` in `.env.local` (e.g. `postgresql://user:password@host/dbname?sslmode=require`) and run migrations: `npm run neon:migrate`
6. Run development server: `npm run dev`
7. Visit http://localhost:3000

## Development workflow

1. Pull `main`
2. Create a new branch for your change
3. Implement and test your work in your branch
4. Open a Pull Request in GitHub to merge your branch into `main`
5. Get at least one 👍 on your PR and then squash merge it

## Using Pretix as an auth provider for local development

Sideburn uses its Pretix instance as the authentication provider for volunteering. Here's how to set it up:

1. If using a local Pretix instance, set it up first:
   1. Checkout Pretix: `git clone git@github.com:tohyperborea/pretix.git`
   2. Build the docker image: `docker build -t local_pretix .`
   3. Start the docker container: `docker run -p 8000:80 local_pretix`
   4. Navigate to `http://localhost:8000/control` and log in with default credentials `admin@localhost`:`admin`
   5. Create a new Organizer with any name. URLs in these instructions will assume name `ORG_NAME`
   6. Navigate to the `Customer accounts` section of `Organizer Settings` (http://localhost:8000/control/organizer/ORG_NAME/edit#tab-0-3-open) and enable `Allow customers to create accounts`. Save.
2. Choose a value for `OAUTH_PROVIDER_ID` in `.env.local`. This can be anything, but keep it short and URL-friendly.
3. Navigate to the `SSO clients` settings under the `Customer accounts` section (http://localhost:8000/control/organizer/ORG_NAME/ssoclients) and click `Create a new SSO client`
4. Fill in any application name, and the following Redirection URI: `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/oauth2/callback/{OAUTH_PROVIDER_ID}` where `{OAUTH_PROVIDER_ID}` matches whatever you have set in `.env.local`
5. Save, and copy the Client Secret displayed at the top to the `OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` value in `.env.local`
6. Copy the Client ID to the `OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` value in `.env.local`
7. Set the value of `OAUTH_DISCOVERY_URL` in `.env.local` to `{PRETIX_URI}/ORG_NAME/.well-known/openid-configuration` where `{PRETIX_URI}` is the URI of your Pretix instance. For local pretix as configured in step 1, this would be `http://localhost:8000`
8. Profit!

Optional: to seed admin users when OAuth is enabled, set `OAUTH_ADMIN_EMAILS` to a comma-separated list of email addresses (for example: `admin@example.org,ops@example.org`). On startup, existing matching users will be granted the admin role, and matching users will also be granted admin when they sign in via OAuth.

### Enforcing valid Pretix tickets per event

If you want to require users to hold a valid Pretix ticket for each event they access:

1. Set `PRETIX_REQUIRE_VALID_TICKET=true`.
2. Set `PRETIX_API_TOKEN` to a Pretix API token that can read orders.
3. Ensure each event's slug in this app matches the Pretix event slug.
4. Optionally set `PRETIX_ORGANIZER` and `PRETIX_API_BASE_URL`.
5. Optional strict filtering: set `PRETIX_REQUIRED_ITEM_IDS` to a comma-separated list of Pretix item IDs that should count as valid tickets (for example: `123,456`).

By default, organizer slug and API base URL are inferred from `OAUTH_DISCOVERY_URL`.

## Production

### Deploying without docker (e.g. Vercel + Neon)

Migrations are run via Liquibase. For local development with Docker, Liquibase runs automatically when you start the database (`npm run db:start`).

For a hosted Postgres (e.g. Neon), run migrations with:

```bash
npm run neon:migrate
```

Ensure `POSTGRES_URL` is set in `.env.local` (e.g. `postgresql://user:password@host/dbname?sslmode=require`). The script connects to the remote database and applies any pending migrations.

**Note**: When `POSTGRES_URL` is set, it overrides individual `POSTGRES_*` environment variables (like `POSTGRES_HOST`, `POSTGRES_USER`, etc.). This is the recommended approach for Neon and other hosted Postgres services.

Then set `POSTGRES_URL` (or the individual `POSTGRES_*` vars) in your deployment (e.g. Vercel env).

### Deploying with docker

1. Create `.env.production` from `.env.example`
2. Build the production docker images: `npm run prod:build`
3. Start the database: `npm run db:start`
4. Start production docker containers: `npm run prod:up`

## Services

### [Mailer Service](mailer)

With `USE_EMAIL_QUEUE` set to `true`, email must be delivered via the [mailer service](mailer). It can be started with `npm run mailer:start`

### [Upload Cleaner Service](upload-cleaner)

Removes user uploaded files that are no longer referenced in the database. It can be started with npm run `upload-cleaner:start`
